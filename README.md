# Youtube Clone
The Youtube Clone is a website that is created to look like a replica of the actual Youtube website. Upon visiting the clone's front page, the user will see a list of videos that will redirect the user to the actual Youtube video's page upon clicking one of the videos. The list of videos and the associated video information is scraped using the 'youtubei' library. In addition, the Youtube clone has a search function where the user can search for a specific category and/or video they want. The search will return a list of up to 20 videos as if the user was searching in the actual Youtube website itself.
